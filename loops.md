# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
Evaluations compare one value in the script to what is expected with a Boolean results :true or false
Common Comparison Operators:
== 	is equal to
=== 	strict equal too
!=  	is not equal to
!== 	strict not equal to
>	greater than
>=	greater than or equal to
<	less than
<=	less than or equal to

## Logical Operators
Logical operators allow you to compare results of more than one comparison operator
Common Logical Operators:
&&	logical and 	(test more than on condition)
||	logical or 	(tests at least one condition)
!	logical not	(takes a single Boolean value and inverts it – i.e. true becomes false)

## Loops
Loops check a condition will run the code block as long the bollean value is true
-	FOR – runs the loop code for a specific number of times
-	WHILE – runs the loop for as long as the value is true
-	DO WHILE – very similar to the WHILE loop; however, will always run the statement inside the curly braces at least once
