# Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators: Evaluating Conditions
Evaluations compare one value in the script to what is expected with a Boolean results :true or false
Common Comparison Operators:
    <ul>
        <li> == 	is equal to</li>
        <li> === 	strict equal too </li>
        <li> !=  	is not equal to </li>
        <li> !== 	strict not equal to </li>
        <li> >	greater than </li>
        <li> >=	greater than or equal to </li>
        <li> <	less than </li>
        <li> <=	less than or equal to </li>
    </ul>
## Logical Operators
Logical operators allow you to compare results of more than one comparison operator
Common Logical Operators:
    <ul> 
        <li> &&	logical and 	(test more than on condition)</li>
        <li> ||	logical or 	    (tests at least one condition)</li>
        <li> !	logical not	    (takes a single Boolean value and inverts it</li>
    </ul>

## Loops
Loops check a condition will run the code block as long the bollean value is true
-	FOR – runs the loop code for a specific number of times
-	WHILE – runs the loop for as long as the value is true
-	DO WHILE – very similar to the WHILE loop; however, will always run the statement inside the curly braces at least once
