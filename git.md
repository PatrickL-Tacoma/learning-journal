## Learning about Git

- Setting up new repository
- Cloning to local folder
- Editing with VS Code

-- Add - Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. 
-- Commit - Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history.
-- Push - Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions.
