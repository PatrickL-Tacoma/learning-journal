## Programming with JavaScript

What is script – a series of step by step instructions
Writing script:
	-	Define the Goal
	-	Design the Script – split the goal into series of tasks that the computer needs to achieve – similar to breaking down a recipe/ Flowcharting is a beneficial tool for visualizing the tasks.  Listing the steps of each task will assist in developing the code.
	-	Code each Step 
Expressions + Operators
	-	Expressions either ‘assign a value to a variable’ or perform and operation to return a single value
	-	Operators allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
		o	Assignment operators
		o	Arithmetic operators
		o	String operators
		o	Comparison operators
		o	Logical operators
Functions
	-	Functions group a series of statements together to perform a specific task that allows for script to reuse functions that might be repetitive.
		o	Function Declaration - Declaring a function (i.e. create a function) give it a name (identifier) and then write the statements within curly braces 
		o	Calling a Function
		o	Declaring Functions that need Information
		o	Calling Functions that need Information
		o	Getting a Single Value out of a Function
