## HTML, CSS, Javascript

####	HTML, CSS, Javascript fit together in layers 

1. 	<html> ***Content Layer*** - The HTML gives the page structure and add semantics
2.	{css} 	***Presentation Layer*** - The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented
3.	Javascript() ***Behavior Layer*** â€“ this is where we change how the page behaves, adding interactivity
