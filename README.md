# Hello Code Fellows 102d7 Class

## Welcome to my first GitHub page

Hello Class, I'm Patrick and I retired from the Air Force after 23 years of various occupations and missions.  My first computer was a Commodore 64 and I built my first PC in 1993.   I enjoyed taking some introductory classes in BASIC and PASCAL programming languages back in the early '90s and I look forward to developing some modern programming skills and a new career.
