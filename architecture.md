## Computer Architecture and Logic

-	Computers are all around us and we use this daily, but how often to we ask how this works.
-	Computers use circuits and logic - they are everywhere – your car, your wrist, your backpack
-	People throughout history have developed tools to make human life simpler
-	All computers do four basic tasks – take input, store it, process information, provide output
o	Input – user directs computer to take input from various sources
o	Information is stored, ready for calling up later
o	Process – takes information from memory and uses this to create output
o	Output can be visual data to the user or date to another system to be used such as a car or other systems.

-	Computers use binary code which is the most basic level computer language that consists of 1’s and 0’s to do work on the internal level
-	All data is made up of these binary numbers and grouped together this is how computers handle input, process the data and output the data result.
-	Binary data is the lowest level of all computers processes – math, pictures, video, games, ect
-	This binary data is handled through electrical circuits that when combined with many other circuits we can make more complex circuits, thus producing more and more complex results

-	Computers and programming allow for unlimited opportunities for developing high tech.

-	Computer programming depends on higher languages to allow programmers to type in languages that are more understandable to people.  This allows people to quickly program data into the computer that will produce items for the physical world.

-	The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the masterpiece of hardware that controls other parts of the computer.

-	Operating systems within computers handle the needs of the computer and acts like a referee that takes the input data and handles what internal systems or hardware are going to handle the output data. (e.g. monitor, sound card, ect)
